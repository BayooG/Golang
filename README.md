______________________________________________
A look  alike Golang  Parser  Using JavaCC 5.0 

this code is parser for essential functionality of Golang like:

1. Varibles declearation 
2. if Statement (if/else)
3. loops (for Statement)
4. switch Statement
5. function declearation

and all small details needed for acomplishing that 

Unfortunatlly I did not have  time to complete the Semantic part . 

this code was written in like 4 hours Before that I did not know a thing about JavaCC .
